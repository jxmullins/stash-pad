Archive all items in the `## Completed` section.

## Rules
- Clear all items from the `## Completed` section
- Optionally move them to an `## Archived` section if one exists
- Confirm with count: "Archived N completed items"
- Handle empty state: "No completed items to archive"

## File Location
Look for `TODO.md` in the project root. If not found, check for `TODOS.md`, `todo.md`, or `.todo/inbox.md`.
