description: Organize inbox items into categories
allowed-tools: [Read, Edit, Write]
---

Categorize all items in the `## Inbox` section of `TODO.md`.

## Default Categories
- **Features** — New functionality to add
- **Improvements** — Enhancements to existing functionality
- **Bug Fixes** — Issues that need fixing
- **Documentation** — Docs, README, examples
- **Ideas** — Raw thoughts, exploratory items

## Rules
- Read the Inbox section
- Analyze each item and determine its best category
- Move items from Inbox to the appropriate category section
- Group related items under subheadings if helpful
- Clear the Inbox after classification
- Show a summary: "Classified N items: Features (X), Bug Fixes (Y), ..."

## Custom Categories
If the TODO.md file has additional sections (e.g., Technical Debt, Research, Questions), use those categories as well.

## File Location
Look for `TODO.md` in the project root. If not found, check for `TODOS.md`, `todo.md`, or `.todo/inbox.md`.
